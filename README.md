# GETTING STARTED

- Base URL: Currently, this app has been deployed and is hosted on GitHub.
- Authentication: At present, this app does not require any form of authentication or API keys.

## Error Handling

Errors that occur in this API solely follow the HTTP response status codes. The 2xx generally indicate "success", the 4xx indicates "client error" while the 5xx generally indicates "server error" which is pretty much rare.

The error data is returned in a principled JSON format as follows:
For a 400 Bad Request error
{
"success": False,
"error": 400,
"message": "bad request"
}
For a 404 Not Found error;
{
'success': False,
'error': 404,
'message': "Not Found"
}

The API will return five error types when requests fail:

- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 405: Method Not Alllowed
- 422: Not Processable
- 500: Internal Server Error (RARE)
